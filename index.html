        Roger is in my opinion the <b>greatest</b> tennis player who ever lived. He has a great <i>serve and volley</i> and his iconic one-hander which might be the best one-hander.</p>

        Rafael Nadal is a unique player in that he is a <i>left-handed</i> player that allows him to play to his opponents natural weakpoint, but vice versa. Rafa is a left-handed player by choice; he is actually a navitvely right-handed player</p>
