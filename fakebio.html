        <p>This is a game that I created in python using the Pygame library. It is my second game that I coded using it and I tried to have semi/pseudo realistic phsyics in it.</p>

        <p>This is a platform game I created in python using the Pygame Library. It is essentially a mario type platformer, except you can't jump past platforms that are above your head. Platforms are more like horizontal walls. There is an enemy that is killable if you attack it from above, but kill you from the side.</p>
